title: Hi, I'm Adela!
---

I’m a software engineer at Google, and an incoming CS Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin, Madison in Fall 2026.

I'm interested in theory of programming languages, and I am actively looking for research assistant positions for 2025-2026.

News: I will be volunteering at [ICFP/SPLASH '25](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025) in Singapore.
